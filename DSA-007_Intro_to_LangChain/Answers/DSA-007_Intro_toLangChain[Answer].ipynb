        "# Introduction to LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is LangChain?\n",
        "LangChain is a framework that helps you combine **language models** with various tools, APIs, and logic to create dynamic workflows and applications. It allows you to build **structured workflows** (LangGraphs) or flexible, real-time decision-makers (Agents) using large language models like GPT.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of LangChain as a **bridge/chain** that connects language models to different tools, databases, or functions, enabling the model to perform more complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example\n",
        "Let’s say you want to build a **flight booking assistant** using LangChain. You can use a **LangGraph** (component of LangChain) to structure the assistant's tasks like this:\n",
        "1. Ask for the user’s destination.\n",
        "2. Search for available flights using an API.\n",
        "3. Show the user the available flights.\n",
        "4. Confirm the booking.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Analogy:\n",
        "Imagine LangChain as a GPS navigation system for your language models:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you follow a predefined route (LangGraph), it guides you step-by-step to your destination.\n",
        "But if there’s a detour or you decide to explore along the way, you can use an Agent to decide the best route dynamically, based on what’s happening in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Refer to the slides for the workflow!**"
